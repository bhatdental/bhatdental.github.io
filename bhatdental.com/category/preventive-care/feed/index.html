Injuries to the mouth and jaw are some of the most common injuries received by athletes. Mouthguards help protect your teeth and gums. If you participate in basketball, boxing, hockey, football, gymnastics, lacrosse, martial arts, racquetball, rugby, track and field, skateboarding, skiing and snowboarding, skydiving, soccer, surfing, volleyball, water polo, weightlifting or wrestling, it is recommended by the American Dental Association that you wear a mouthguard.</p>
<h2>Types of mouthguards</h2>
<p>Choosing the right mouthguard is important. There are three basic types of mouthguards: the pre-made mouthguard, the &#8220;boil-and-bite&#8221; fitted mouthguard, and a custom-made mouthguard. When you choose a mouthguard, be sure to pick one that is tear-resistant, well fitted for your mouth and easy to keep clean. Also make sure it does not prevent you from breathing properly during use. If you wear braces or a retainer, it is imperative for you to wear a mouthguard. Your dentist can show you how to wear a mouthguard properly and how to choose the right mouthguard to protect your smile.</p>
<h2>Taking care of your mouthguard</h2>
<p>Similar to a retainer, braces, or any other special dental appliance, it is important to take care of your mouthguard by storing it properly and keeping it clean. You should also know when to replace your old mouthguard with a new one. Here are a few simple ways to keep your mouthguard clean and working correctly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gently scrub your mouthguard after each use with a toothbrush and toothpaste.</li>
<li>Store your mouthguard in a protective case.</li>
<li>Do not leave your mouthguard in the sun or in hot water;  it may melt or become deformed.</li>
<li>Replace your mouthguard at the beginning of every new sports season. You should also replace your mouthguard if you notice it has become worn and no longer fits properly.</li>
<li>Do not wear a retainer with your mouthguard. If you wear braces, your dentist will help design a mouthguard to protect your teeth and your braces.</li>
<li>Do not chew on or cut pieces off of your mouthguard.</li>
<li>Bring your mouthguard to each dental checkup, and your dentist can check to make sure it&#8217;s still in good shape.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our goal is to help minimize your chances of a sports related injury. Be sure to ask your dentist about mouthguards at your next dental checkup &#8211; GO TEAM!</p>

The strength and durability of traditional dental materials make them useful for situations where restored teeth must withstand extreme forces that result from chewing, often in the back of the mouth.</p>
<p>Newer dental fillings include ceramic and plastic compounds that mimic the appearance of natural teeth. These compounds, often called composite resins, are usually used on the front teeth where a natural appearance is important, but they can also be used on the back teeth depending on the location and extent of the tooth decay.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s right for me?</h2>
<p>Several factors influence the performance, durability, longevity and expense of dental restorations, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>The components used in the filling material</li>
<li>The amount of tooth structure remaining</li>
<li>Where and how the filling is placed</li>
<li>The chewing load that the tooth will have to bear</li>
<li>The length and number of visits needed to prepare and adjust the restored tooth</li>
</ul>
<p>Before your treatment begins, your doctor will discuss with you all of your options and help you choose the best filling for your particular case. In preparation for this discussion it may be helpful to understand the two basic types of dental fillings — direct and indirect.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Direct fillings</strong> are fillings placed into a prepared cavity in a single visit. They include glass ionomers, resin ionomers, and composite (resin) fillings. The dentist prepares the tooth, places the filling, and adjusts it in one appointment.</li>
<li><strong>Indirect fillings</strong> generally require two or more visits. They include inlays, onlays, veneers, crowns, and bridges fabricated with gold, base metal alloys, ceramics, or composites. During the first visit, the dentist prepares the tooth and makes an impression of the area to be restored. The dentist then places a temporary covering over the prepared tooth. The impression is sent to a dental laboratory, which creates the dental restoration. At the next appointment, the dentist cements the restoration into the prepared cavity and adjusts it as needed.</li>
</ul>

It is difficult for your toothbrush to get in between the small cracks and grooves on your teeth. If left alone, those tiny areas can develop tooth decay. Sealants give your teeth extra protection against decay and help prevent cavities.</p>
<p>Dental sealants are plastic resins that bond and harden in the deep grooves on your tooth&#8217;s surface. When a tooth is sealed, the tiny grooves become smooth and are less likely to harbor plaque. With sealants, brushing your teeth becomes easier and more effective.</p>
<p><a href="http://bhatdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sealants.gif"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-306" src="http://bhatdental.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sealants.gif" alt="sealants" width="250" height="200" /></a>Sealants are typically applied to children&#8217;s teeth after their permanent teeth have erupted as a preventive measure against tooth decay. However, adults can also receive sealants on healthy teeth. It is more common to seal permanent teeth rather than baby teeth, but every patient has unique needs, and your dentist will recommend sealants on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Sealants typically last from three to five years, although it is fairly common to see adults with sealants still intact from childhood. A dental sealant only provides protection when it is fully intact so if your sealants come off, let your dentist know, and schedule an appointment for your teeth to be resealed.</p>

<p>You brush your teeth twice a day, floss regularly and visit the dentist every six months, but did you know that rinsing with fluoride — a mineral that helps prevent cavities and tooth decay — also helps keep your teeth healthy and strong.</p>
<p>Fluoride is effective in preventing cavities and tooth decay by coating your teeth and preventing plaque from building up and hardening on the tooth&#8217;s surface.</p>
<h2>Fluoride comes in two varieties, topical and systemic:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Topical fluoride</em></strong> is applied directly to the tooth and includes toothpastes and mouth rinses.</li>
<li><strong><em>Systemic fluorides</em></strong> are generally only used by your dentist and are not often available for at home use. Systemic fluoride treatments are generally designed to help protect the oral health of children undergoing dental procedures. Fluoride used in the dentist/orthodontists office is often a much stronger concentration than in toothpaste or mouthwash, but is available at some drug stores or a pharmacy (ask your dentist before purchasing professional strength fluoride).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Receiving a fluoride treatment from your dentist</h2>
<p>A fluoride treatment in your dentist&#8217;s office takes just a few minutes. After the treatment, patients may be asked not to rinse, eat, or drink for at least 30 minutes in order to allow the teeth to absorb the fluoride. Depending on your oral health or your doctor&#8217;s recommendation, you may be required to have a fluoride treatment every three, six, or twelve months. Your doctor may also prescribe an at-home fluoride product such as a mouthwash, gel, or antibacterial rinse.</p>
<h2>How to choose the right fluoride treatment</h2>
<p>When choosing your own at home fluoride product (such as toothpaste or mouthwash), always check for the American Dental Association&#8217;s (ADA) seal of acceptance. Products marked with the ADA seal of approval have been carefully examined by the ADA, and approved based on safety and effectiveness. Take care of your teeth and smile bright with dental fluoride treatments!</p>

By practicing good oral hygiene at home and scheduling regular checkups with your dentist, you can help keep your smile bright and healthy for many years to come. Here are a few simple ways that you can prevent the build-up of plaque and cavities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brush your teeth at least twice a day with a soft-bristled toothbrush. Use fluoride toothpaste to remove food particles and plaque from the tooth surfaces. Also be sure to brush the top surface of your tongue; this will remove any extra plaque causing food particles, and help keep your breath fresh!</li>
<li>Clean between your teeth by flossing at least once a day. You can also use a mouthwash to help kill bacteria and freshen your breath. Decay-causing bacteria can linger between teeth where toothbrush bristles can&#8217;t reach. Floss and mouthwash will help remove plaque and food particles from between the teeth and under the gum line.</li>

		Eat a balanced diet, and try to avoid extra-sugary treats. Nutritious foods such as raw vegetables, plain yogurt, cheese or fruit can help keep your smile healthy.</li>
<li>
		Remember to schedule regular checkups with your dentist every six months for a professional teeth cleaning.</li>
<li>
		Ask your dentist about dental sealants, a protective plastic coating that can be applied to the chewing surfaces of the back teeth where decay often starts.</li>
<li>
		If you play sports, be sure to ask your dentist about special mouth guards designed to protect your smile.</li>
