<h2><i>Root Canal therapy can save an infected tooth that otherwise would need to be extracted.</i></h2>
<p>At Bhat Dental Associates we believe in the importance of educating our patients about keeping their natural teeth for life. Some of our patients who require tooth extraction could have visited us sooner and saved their teeth with a root canal therapy. Unfortunately, people often assume that root canal treatment is lengthy and painful, however, thanks to today’s technology and techniques, root canal treatment is as simple, safe and quick as receiving a filling!</p>
<h4>When is a root canal required?</h4>
<p>If you are starting to notice a dark coloring on your tooth, if your old fillings are starting to deteriorate, or if your teeth are becoming increasingly sensitive to hot and/or cold, you may require a root canal treatment. These symptoms are caused by an infected tooth pulp which acts as the central nervous system of your teeth and delivers key nutrients to keep the tooth health and functional.</p>
<p>There are a few early warning signs and symptoms that can indicate the presence of infected nerve tissue in the mouth. Root canal treatment can save your teeth that otherwise would need to be removed the longer it is left untreated. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tenderness when chewing</li>
<li>Toothache and sensitivity</li>
<li>Trauma to the tooth or jaw</li>
<li>Deep tooth decay</li>
<li>Severe gum disease</li>
</ul>
<p>Time is essential, too. If treatment is not undertaken swiftly, this can cause severe pain, abscesses and even bone loss to the infected tooth site.  As a result, the tooth will not be able to receive root canal therapy, and instead, may need to be removed.</p>
<p>At Bhat Dental Associates we can determine the level of damage after conducting a full mouth examination to assess the infected tooth and provide the necessary treatment.</p>
<p><b><i>What is a Root Canal treatment?</i></b></p>
<p>Root canal treatment, also known as Endodontics, is a dental procedure to treat infection at the center of a tooth (the root canal system).<b> </b>Our front teeth generally have one and sometimes two root canals, premolars also usually have one or two root canals, while our molar teeth generally three to four canals.The<b> </b>Root canal treatment is a process whereby inflamed or dead pulp is removed from the inside of the tooth, enabling a tooth that was causing pain to be retained.</p>
<h4>The root canal process</h4>
<p>Depending on the complexity of your case, your root canal treatment may need to be performed over several visits. Generally, our professional dentists will assess your tooth to identify how much damage there is. Once this has been discovered and you are happy to move forward with treatment, we will numb the area and create an opening at the top of the tooth. The diseased pulp tissue is then removed from inside of the tooth and the root canals are cleaned. If your tooth has suffered structural damage in the process, we will place a dental crown over the tooth to help maintain its structural integrity.</p>
<h4>How successful is root canal treatment?</h4>
<p>The sooner you commence root canal treatment the greater the successful outcome will be. When you receive root canal treatment it is important to follow a consistent oral hygiene routine to ensure the longevity of your treatment. As with any invasive process there are certain risks involved and on rare occasions complications may arise such as removing the tooth all together. These complications could result in the need for additional treatment or the need for the tooth to be extracted. However, these complications are rare and in most cases root canal treatment is very successful</p>
<p>If you believe you may be suffering from an infection in the pulp or nerve tissue of your tooth, at Bhat Dental Associates  we can help you. Our highly experienced team can diagnose and treat your infected tooth and get you back on the road to a healthy smile!</p>

<p>You may not have experienced it yet, but as we grow and develop into adults we often find maturity and age has fantastic perks – but also has some  handful of downfalls.</p>
<p>Here at <a title="My tooth is infected…what can I do?" href="http://bhatdental.com">Bhat Dental Associates</a>, our patients are often curiously asking why they have to get their wisdom teeth removed. Growing up is a thrilling adventure, but around the ages of late-teens to mid-twenties, many experience the uninvited arrival of nasty and painful wisdom teeth!</p>
<p>Wisdom teeth are set of four teeth that break though the gums at the end of each jaw. For some lucky people, their wisdom teeth may never develop and for others they may grow out without much drama. Typically however, around 80% of young adults will need their wisdom teeth removed.</p>
<h3>So why would I get them?</h3>
<p>Wisdom teeth were used for dietary reasons. However as generations continue and we evolve through the ages, wisdom teeth have tended to become less useful in accordance to our eating habits. Our mouth shapes are now narrowing; constricting the space available for wisdom teeth. This is known to cause irritation as the teeth attempt to surface and can lead to damage around the nerve tissue, along with a handful of other side-effects.</p>
<h3>How do I know if my wisdom teeth are emerging?</h3>
<p>As <a href="http://www.australiafairdental.com.au/treatments">wisdom teeth</a> surface, you’re likely to experience a bit of aches and pains through the jaw and gums. This isn’t the end of the world! Consider infants as they struggle through their teething – constant crying in pain. You have to understand that just because your gum and jaw is hurting, it doesn’t necessarily mean your wisdom teeth need to be taken out.</p>
<p>This pain is because the tooth has to grow and forge its own path through the existing gums and jaw. This may happen all in one go, but in most cases wisdom teeth will grow in stages over months or even years. If the tooth finishes growing with no issues, the gum should heal relatively quickly until the movement of the tooth disturbs the gums again.</p>
<p>We recommend at <a title="My tooth is infected…what can I do?" href="http://www.australiafairdental.com.au/">Bhat Dental Associates</a> that even if you are not experiencing overactive symptoms and are between the ages of 17 and 21, we would advise for you to book an appointment with our dentist now and undergo an assessment. This is because while you are still young your gums can potentially heal faster, shortening the recovery time.</p>
<h3>Symptoms to look out for…</h3>
<p>If you are experiencing a persistent amount of pain, its best to book a consultation with our professional team at Bhat Dental Associates and determine what treatments need to be advised. Pay attention to the list bellow and see how relevant these symptoms are to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experiencing headaches and prolonged pain in the jaw, sometimes accompanied with blurred vision in severe cases</li>
<li>Gums are swelling from infection – could eventuate to abscesses</li>
<li>Torn and sore cheeks on the inside that are not healing properly</li>
<li>Bad taste in the mouth, sometimes making you feel sick in the stomach</li>
<li>Teeth are becoming decayed from difficulty with cleaning</li>
<li>The teeth are angling awkwardly and could potentially crowed or damage the adjacent teeth</li>
</ul>
<h3>What if my wisdom teeth are already grown?</h3>
<p>Although wisdom teeth generally are in need of removal, you may be one of the lucky people who are unaffected by the change. If this is the case, you should have had the following characteristics throughout the growth:</p>
<ul>
<li>The eruption was successful and infection free</li>
<li>None of the surrounding teeth suffered damage</li>
<li>The teeth are within brushing and flossing range</li>
<li>Your natural bite is still well-aligned and unharmed</li>
</ul>
<p>Having successful wisdom tooth growth is definitely a thing to celebrate! We would suggest though, that even if your wisdom teeth have happily set in, make sure to take regular trips to the dentist every 6 months to ensure the health of your pearly whites.</p>
<p>If you think that even one of the above points didn’t match your wisdom tooth growth, take the time to book an appointment with our trained professionals today – because poor oral health can often escalate quickly when not kept in check.</p>
<h3>How wisdom teeth extraction can benefit you!</h3>
<p>Monitor your oral hygiene by booking in with our fantastic team of specialists and staff. Removal is often easier for younger people, so if you’re concerned about your wisdom teeth, make sure you take care to see a professional before the issue worsens.</p>

<h2>Whether you’re suffering from single tooth loss or even total tooth loss, we can help you.</h2>
<p>Here at Bhat Dental Associates we strive to ensure patients have access to the best solutions for tooth loss available. Understanding your options when it comes to tooth replacement is important in order for you to make the right decision. The following article discusses your dental implant choices and explains in which circumstances mini dental implants could be suitable for you.</p>
<h3>Regular dental implants</h3>
<p>Dental implants are quickly becoming a preferred solution to tooth loss. They provide a solution with a high success rate, which ultimately offers a life like imitation tooth that is secured to the jaw with a titanium tooth root replacement.</p>
<h3>Dental implants benefit the patient in a variety of ways:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>The results are long lasting</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other tooth replacement methods tend to last between 5-7 years but dental implants are made from materials that, if cared for properly, can last a lifetime.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Restores facial structure in cases where ,there is multiple tooth loss</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you lose multiple teeth the natural structure of your face can change. This is because the jawbone can begin to deteriorate from the lack of stimulation that was previously provided by the tooth’s root.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>The replacement looks and acts as a natural tooth</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dental implants are strong and stable. Once completed with a restoration they will look and feel like natural teeth in your mouth. They will also function as natural teeth for general daily activities such as eating, speaking and smiling.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>They are permanent and non-removable</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With dental implants you can keep your teeth in your mouth rather than in a cup like removable dentures. You can also avoid embarrassing mishaps with slipping or speech impediments sometimes accompanied by removable alternatives.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>You can eat whatever you like</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Dental implants don’t require the need for dietary adjustments and offer the chance to bite naturally without changing the way the food tastes and feels.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>The crowns attached to the implants will not get cavities</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your new replacements will not get holes from plaque and bacteria although it is still important that you take care of them by practicing healthy eating habits and attending regular check-ups to ensure they remain strong.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>They won’t damage your healthy teeth</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other alternatives such as tooth supported bridges require removing large amounts of the natural teeth that sit on either side of the gap. Not only does this damage your teeth but as it doesn’t support the jaw it can also cause the jawbone to deteriorate.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Proven to produce high success rates</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The dental implants treatment is predictable and reliable, with decades of tracking the results. The treatment is proven to have more than a 90% chance of success for non-smokers.</p>
<h3>Mini dental implants</h3>
<p>Mini dental implants are more commonly used for supporting dentures. They provide a fast solution that is minimally invasive and requires less down-time. Mini dental implants are also known to be used for single tooth loss but they depend on your oral condition.</p>
<h3>As an alternative to traditional dental implants, mini dental implants:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Can be used immediately</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Traditional dental implants generally require 2 appointments. This is because the nature of the implant placement requires a period of time to heal before being functionally able to use. Mini implants can be used immediately.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Provide a stable foundation for a denture</h4>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using mini dental implants to secure a denture provides a strong hold for your dental arches. Not only does it stop your denture from moving around uncomfortably but because the implant is smaller and less invasive, the new denture can be fixed during the same appointment which means you won’t have to go without teeth for the denture healing period.</p>
<h3>Putting your needs first</h3>
<p>Here at Bhat Dental Associates, we offer sedation dentistry for your treatment and use a local anesthetic to numb the area prior to the treatment. Our dental professionals will work with you to help identify a treatment plan that is suitable for your needs.</p>

<h2>The debate continues between the effectiveness of traditional braces, compared to Invisalign…</h2>
<p>The truth is that both will improve your teeth alignment and choosing one over the other is really dependent upon your lifestyle and the severity of your bite.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://bhatdental.com" target="_blank">Bhat Dental Associates</a> we help each patient decide what treatment is best for them, that’s why it’s always nice to know some of the main differences and uses to better inform your decision.</p>
<h3>What is Invisalign?</h3>
<p>So let’s get straight into the discussion, what is Invisalign anyways? By utilising a series of transparent aligners, Invisalign is a removable and virtually transparent orthodontic system for those who want to realign their teeth without having a mouthful of metal.</p>
<h3>Why choose metal braces?</h3>
<p>If you’re not bothered by the look that comes with visible braces they can be extremely effective in correcting your teeth because:</p>
<ul>
<li>They allow a full scope of tooth movement which means they can be used in extreme cases</li>
<li>Your teeth will move rapidly</li>
<li>They are fixed in your mouth</li>
<li>Everyone is a candidate for braces, children and adults can wear them</li>
<li>Have fun changing your colourful brackets and wires for the festive season (red and green for Christmas)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are really concerned about the look of braces but like the benefits, lingual braces may be an option for you! Lingual braces are just like traditional braces with one exception- they are attached to the inside of your smile! They are virtually invisible to those around you. Lingual braces normally generate results in the same amount of time as traditional braces but of course you cannot usually see them.</p>
<h3>Why choose Invisalign?</h3>
<p>Well, besides the fact that you can’t see the Invisalign system there are a few more reasons why Invisalign might be the best option for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can effectively treats a wide variety of cases, including crowding, spacing, crossbite, overbite and underbite</li>
<li>You can maintain your regular oral hygiene routine by removing the devise during any time</li>
<li>There are no dietary restrictions as the aligners can simply be removed to enjoy your favourite foods</li>
<li>Can free up your busy schedule, with office visits only every four to six weeks.</li>
<li>Instead of sharp metal it is made up of smooth plastic</li>
</ul>
<h3>What are my options at Bhat Dental Associates?</h3>
<p>We understand that everyone requires a different treatment according to their lifestyle and their orthodontic requirements. We offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full traditional orthodontics</li>
<li>Smile Fast Magic Braces™</li>
<li> Lingual Braces</li>
<li>Invisalign</li>
<li>Early Intervention Orthodontics</li>
<li> Six Month Smiles®</li>
</ul>
<p>At<a href="http://www.australiafairdental.com.au/" target="_blank"> Bhat Dental Associates</a> we also offer Orthopaedics, which are used during childhood years, orthopaedics are designed to enhance the long term health and appearance of children as they grow. This might save your child from braces during their adolescence and helps reduce the risk of misaligned jaws, severe tooth impactions and overbites.<br />
For those patients who don’t want to spend the year with braces we also offer Fastbraces® which are a rapid treatment normally taking only a few months! Traditional braces usually work in two stages: the first moving the crown of the tooth, and the second stage moving the root of the tooth. Fastbraces® uses a bracket and an advanced shaped wire to correct the position of the root of the tooth that exerts pressure on the teeth and allows them to straighten quickly.</p>

<p>Because of our passion for perfection we only want to offer the best treatments to our clients, and that means braces! <a title="Orthodontics" href="http://www.australiafairdental.com.au/services/orthodontics/">Braces</a> are the most efficient way to straighten up problem teeth and avoid frequent trips to the dentist later in life. While they can feel and look a little odd when you first get them on, you’ll get used to them in no time and be on your way to a perfect, pearly white smile.</p>
<h3>Braces Basics</h3>
<p>Braces can take anywhere from 6 months to a couple of years to complete their treatment. Frequent visits to the orthodontist and general checkups will be required to make sure everything is on the right track.</p>
<h3>What makes up braces?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Bracket</li>
<li>Wire</li>
<li>Hook</li>
<li>Rubber bands</li>
</ul>
<p>While it can feel like a mass of metal in the start, braces are made up of a number of functional components which all help to straighten your teeth. The bracket is the squarish part on each tooth which is surrounded by elastic ties, often fixed with hooks where you will attach your rubber bands. Wire runs along the teeth in a horizontal line to keep all of the teeth from separating.</p>
<h3>Tips for selling the idea of braces to your kids!</h3>
<p>At <a title="Braces don’t have to be a burden!" href="http://www.australiafairdental.com.au/">Bhat Dental Associates</a> we know all about how hard it is to get kids to jump at the idea of braces. While they may not be thanking you when they first get them on we’ve got some suggestions to get your kids to accept braces as a necessity and maybe even an exciting adventure! Here are some positive pitches for braces:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can customise the colour of the brackets and the rubber bands</li>
<li>They’ll have straighter teeth than their friends</li>
<li>The sooner they get them the sooner they will have perfect teeth</li>
<li>They can avoid frequent visits to the dentist when they’re older</li>
</ul>
<h3>Keep comfortable while you’re bound to your braces</h3>
<p>There are a couple of basic tips to keep comfortable while wearing braces. The most common issue people have is ulcers where the bracket rubs on the gum or underside of the lip. There is a really simple and easy way to prevent this and that’s by rubbing wax on the brackets whenever you feel friction. Another tip is to cut hard or difficult to eat foods into bite size pieces, and avoid eating very solid foods when you first get your braces fitted.</p>
<h3>At Bhat Dental Associates we don’t shy away from alternative technology to help make your teeth look great!</h3>
<p>Braces are a great way to align your teeth but sometimes they’re not the best aesthetic solution. While Bhat Dental Associates believes that braces are the most concrete way to get efficient results, there are a number of alternatives which can straighten up your teeth.</p>
<h3>Invisalign</h3>
<p>Invisalign is like a transparent plastic coat for your teeth. This coat is worn during the day and over time will improve the straightness of your teeth.</p>
<h3>Mouthpiece</h3>
<p>Another subtle option to straighten your teeth is a dental mouthpiece. Dental mouthpieces are worn while sleeping and feel like a full mouth guard you might wear at a hockey game. It forces teeth into the right position gradually so in the first few months you’ll wake up with a little tenderness in the teeth.</p>
<p>If you’ve been considering braces, or want to know about other options to straighten your teeth ask one of our dentists at your next appointment with Bhat Dental Associates.</p>

<p>Smiling is the universal indicator of happiness, and is a very important communication tool in your personal and professional life. If your searching for a reason to smile, read on to discover our top five reasons to smile:</p>
<h3>1. Smiling can make you happy!</h3>
<p>A natural mood-booster, smiling sends a message to your brain that you are happy. In response to this your brain releases feel good hormones such as endorphins which in turn instantly gives you a natural high.</p>
<h3>2. Smiling can make people around you happy!</h3>
<p>Many studies have revealed that smiling is contagious – something as simple as seeing a friend or a stranger smile can activate the muscles in your face to make the same expression, without you being consciously aware of it! The same goes for frowning, so turn that frown upside down to spread joy to those around you.</p>
<h3>3. Smiling makes you more attractive</h3>
<p>Research has shown that 96% of adults believe that an attractive smile is one of the most appealing physical traits of a potential partner. So the easiest way to be better looking is to flash your beautiful grin!</p>
<h3>4. Smiling can relieve stress</h3>
<p>Smiling has been shown to reduce symptoms associated with anxiety. A big smile signals to your brain that you are feeling happy (even if you are not) which in turn slows your breathing and heart rate.</p>
<h3>5. Smiling can help you land your dream job</h3>
<p>Research has revealed that 2 in 5 recruiters would pass over a potential candidate purely based on the fact that they did not smile during their job interview! In fact, a study has revealed a connection between the whiteness of a presidential candidates teeth and the likelihood of them winning the election!</p>
<p>If you lack the confidence to smile, at <a title="Home" href="http://www.australiafairdental.com.au/">Australia Fair Dental Care</a> we can provide a range of cosmetic and <a title="I want to enhance the entire appearance of my smile!" href="http://www.australiafairdental.com.au/i-want/enhance-my-smile-with-smile-makeovers/">restorative dental treatments</a> to enhance your pearly whites.

<h3><i>Brushing your teeth is a part of our daily lives and should be done at least twice daily, but how do you know you’re doing it properly?</i></h3>
<p>Here at Bhat Dental Associates we share some top tips for brushing that will help keep your teeth clean and most importantly – healthy! For many patients we see at our  practice, we can notice the effects of poor brushing techniques when you visit for your general checkup.</p>
<h2><b><i>Mistake No. 1: Wrong brush</i></b></h2>
<p>Brushing your teeth should feel comfortable: consider the size of your mouth and the size and comfort of the tooth brush handle. While some brushes have angled bristles, others have straight ones. What is important when buying a toothbrush? Bristles that are too stiff can aggravate the gums. The ADA recommends a soft-bristled brush to help remove plaque without damaging the tooth.</p>
<h2><b><i>Mistake No. 2: Not taking the time</i></b></h2>
<p>Brushing twice daily is the recommendation; however three times a day can also be beneficial if you are brushing lightly. With too much time between brushing, this allows plaque to build up, which can increase the risk of gum inflammation and other problems. We also recommend brushing for at least two minutes which allows you enough time to brush all the surfaces.</p>
<h2><b><i>Mistake No. 3: Too much is bad</i></b></h2>
<p>Excessive brushing can wear away  the enamel on the surface of your tooth, which can expose the root of the tooth and cause irritation. This irritation can move to the gums and cause even more discomfort. Brushing too hard can also erode tooth enamel. We recommend brushing very gently for two to three minutes, twice daily.</p>
<h2><b><i>Mistake No. 4: Too repetitive</i></b></h2>
<p>We often notice that many patients have a particular spot that gets missed on a regular basis. Many people start brushing the same part of their mouth over and over and therefore get bored when it comes to the other areas, or simply forget about them all together. It’s important to mix it up and start with different places of the mouth to help ensure you are keeping it fresh and different every time you brush.</p>
<h2><b><i>What you can do to maintain a healthy smile</i></b></h2>
<p>The best thing you can do for your smile is to maintain a regular oral hygiene routine while receiving regular,once in six months dental checkups. Your regular upkeep will help ensure you keep your teeth clean between visits and during your appointment we can assess your mouth for any concerns. Just because your mouth feels healthy doesn’t mean it is. Often dental decay can go unnoticed for a significant period and it isn’t until you have a professional assessment that you may realize you require treatment.</p>
<h2><b><i>Visit Bhat Dental Associates today</i></b></h2>
<p>Here at our Bhat Dental Associates  we pride ourselves on providing outstanding results in a comfortable and welcoming environment. Our team of highly qualified dental professionals are dedicated to achieving optimal oral outcomes for the entire family. When you visit Bhat Dental Associates you are receiving care from a dedicated, friendly team.

<h2>At Bhat Dental Associates we know the beautiful results you get after a professional clean… here is how you can keep your teeth looking beautiful until your next appointment!</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.australiafairdental.com.au/">At Bhat Dental Associates </a>, we know that maintaining your oral health is key to possessing beautiful and healthy teeth to last a lifetime. Since it has been found that dental issues are often associated with other health conditions, it is also important to maintain oral health to safeguard your body, too!</p>
<p>We know there are a lot of products out there that we could recommend, but we also know that many Americans are searching for an answer that isn’t loaded with chemicals. That is why we have compiled these tips that can be performed at home, without the need for any harmful substances! Continue reading to discover how you can keep your mouth in good health between visits to our practice.</p>
<h3>Eat healthy to keep your mouth healthy…</h3>
<p>By consuming crunchy natural foods such as apples and celery, you are automatically cleaning your teeth! This is due to their acidic nature, and the crunchier the food, the cleaner your teeth will become. So be sure to eat good, healthy food such as fruits and vegetables to enhance your oral health and your total health, too!</p>
<p>Eating strawberries has also been found to help whiten teeth, as their acidic level and abrasive texture helps to remove bacteria accumulation and effectively whiten the smile! Make sure to rinse your mouth after consuming strawberries – they may help your teeth but their dense color may hinder your attempt!</p>
<h3>Consume more dairy…</h3>
<p>It has been found that dairy foods such as cheese, milk and other products contain important minerals that work to strengthen teeth and also enhance their appearance! Stronger enamel means stronger teeth and more protection against tooth decay.</p>
<h3>Use a straw…</h3>
<p>At Bhat Dental Associates, we recommend to abstain from soft drinks, sweetened foods and other consumables that have an impact on your smile. If you do not wish to cut these foods out, then use a straw to minimize the contact sugar has against your teeth. By sipping on a straw the sugars travel straight to the tongue and bypass the teeth – keeping your teeth clean and healthy.</p>
<h3>Avoid over-the-counter tooth whitening products…</h3>
<p>Many patients talk about over-the-counter tooth whitening products.However we recommend refraining from giving into the temptation of low-cost, easy tooth whitening systems. At Bhat Dental Associates , our dental professionals are trained to discover the source of your tooth discoloration, and recommend treatment to expertly brighten your smile.</p>
<p>Some tooth discoloration is caused by a damaged nerve inside the tooth, which would be impossible to solve with over-the-counter tooth whitening products!</p>
<h3>Our tooth whitening solution…</h3>
<p>We are dedicated to helping you achieve the smile of your dreams, and as such provide a superior <a title="Teeth Whitening" href="http://www.australiafairdental.com.au/services/cosmetic-dentist-gold-coast/teeth-whitening-gold-coast/">tooth whitening treatment</a>. If you have tried the above hints and tips and have had no luck, book an appointment at Bhat Dental Associates ,so we can examine your teeth and find the source of your discoloration. Our treatment consists of utilizing a safe bleaching product that dramatically lightens your smile. Our treatment is fast and effective, allowing you to have the smile of your dreams!</p>
